# Snake_Game_using_Reinforcement-Learning
This project is an implementation of the classic Snake game using reinforcement learning techniques. The goal is to train an agent to play the game effectively through interaction with a virtual environment.

Usage

Once the environment is set up, you can train the agent or play the game using pre-trained models.

Configuration

You can configure various aspects of the game and training process in the config.py file. This includes parameters such as the size of the game board, the learning rate, discount factor, and more.

Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
